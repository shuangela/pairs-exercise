Reconnection Strategies (as a title)

When a Mule app starts, a connectivity test runs on components, such as the HTTP connector, that need to connect to an external server. If the test fails, the default behavior is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment of the app, instead of blocking the deployment.

You can change the default behavior by setting a specified number of reconnection attempts after an initial failure. This change will force the deployment to fail if all reconnection attempts fail.

* Fail Deployment (`failsDeployment`): Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and any configured reconection attempts are exhausted.
* Reconnect (`reconnect`): Takes two parameters: reconnection attempts and the interval ('count') at which to execute them. For example, you might set a count of 5 reconnection attempts at a `frequency` of every `4000` milliseconds (ms). Defaults to 2 reconnection attempts at a frequency of `2000ms`.

Example that fails after 5 reconnection attempts with a '4000 ms' attempt frequency:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Config" doc:name="HTTP Request Config">
  <http:request-conection host="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" port="80" >
    <reconnection failsDeployment="true" >
      <reconnect frequency="4000" count="5" />
    </reconnection
  </http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>
----
Alternatively, you can change the default behavior by forcing the Mule app to attempt reconnection at a given interval forever, or until the app is able to reconnect.

* Reconnect Forever (reconnect-forever): Attempts to reconnect at a given interval, for example, every 4000 ms for as long as the app runs. Defaults to every 2000 ms. Because there is no limit on the number of retries, no value for count is specified.

Example with a '4000 ms' attempt frequency:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Config" doc:name="HTTP Request Config">
<http:request-connection host="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts" port="80" >
  <reconnection>
    <reconnect-forever frequency="4000"/>
  </reconnection>
</http:request-connection>
</http:request-config>
